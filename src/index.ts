/**
 * Dedicated OpenCode Go adapter plugin. Registers one `opencode-go` route
 * whose catalog is the curated table intersected with the gateway's live model
 * listing, and installs the `llm-opencode-go` settings section: the Web UI
 * renders it as its own settings page where the API key and every knob are
 * edited, and a change reaches the next request without a restart. The plugin
 * exists because the gateway has wire requirements a generic pi-ai route
 * cannot express: a mandatory per-conversation `x-opencode-session` routing
 * header and a model list that rotates faster than any shipped catalog.
 *
 * Configuration layers like every settings-backed plugin: a `cordis.yml`
 * entry supplies the composition base and the settings document overrides it
 * field by field.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * - id: llm-opencode-go
 *   name: 'dsh-x6nux-opencode'
 *   config:
 *     enabled: true                     # false withdraws the route; the plugin stays mounted
 *     apiKeyEnv: OPENCODE_API_KEY       # default
 *     baseURL: https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1   # default
 *     refreshMinutes: 60                # live catalog re-resolution interval
 * ```
 *
 * The credential resolves per request through the credentials seam, falling
 * back to the process environment — the same reference semantics the generic
 * pi-ai adapter uses. The route registers atomically: if another adapter
 * family already owns `opencode-go` (a profile in `llm-pi-ai`, for example),
 * the refusal is logged with the reason and everything else this plugin does
 * still works.
 *
 * @module dsh-x6nux-opencode
